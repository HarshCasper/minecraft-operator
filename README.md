# Minecraft Operator

A Kubernetes [operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) for dedicated servers of the
video game [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition).
This allows you to administer and configure a Minecraft server solely using the Kubernetes API â€” no remote shell, SFTP,
or graphical admin interfaces are required.

Note that this is ðŸš§ alpha-grade ðŸš§ software. No guarantee is provided (see the [license](LICENSE)), and users are
responsible for the security and data-integrity of their own servers. The API surface is subject to change. This
software is not endorsed or supported by Microsoft, Mojang, or the Minecraft development team.

All the heavy-lifting is done by the excellent [itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server).
That container image is what is actually deployed into the cluster as a `Pod`. This project isn't endorsed or
supported by itzg either.

## Installing

Use `make install` from the root of this directory with your cluster configured in `kubectl`.

### Tags

By default the `latest` tag is used, which is the latest published version. You can also use a specific published version
using it's tag (e.g., `v0.2.3`) or `edge` if you want the latest commit on the main branch.

## Usage

You can configure a server like this. The operator will create a `Pod` and `Service` to this specification. Note that
the API uses "allowList" in place of "whitelist", but it is applied to the server in the same way.
